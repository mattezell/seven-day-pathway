/**
 * Read one public program page and draft a registry entry from it.
 *
 * The five programs in this registry were read by hand on the morning of the
 * event. That does not scale, and "someone reads every page by hand forever" is
 * not an answer to how a connector network in a city of 99 neighborhoods gets
 * current information.
 *
 * So this is the same job, run as a tool. Claude reads the fetched page and
 * drafts the entry. The important part is what happens next: every source_quote
 * it produced is checked, mechanically, against the text that was actually
 * fetched. A quote that is not literally on the page fails the run. The model
 * is not trusted to be accurate; it is trusted to be checkable, and then it is
 * checked.
 *
 * The draft is written to research/ for a human to approve. Nothing here writes
 * to public/data/programs.json. A person still decides what a connector is
 * allowed to repeat.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/research-program.mjs <url> [--id PROGRAM-ID]

const PROMPT = `You are extracting one training program into a registry that community connectors
use to tell people what is true about it. A connector repeating something wrong spends
credibility they cannot get back, so this registry treats an unknown as a result, never as
a gap to fill in.

  "credential": "what the person ends up holding",
  "credential_source_quote": "verbatim sentence from the page, or null",
  "cost_usd": number or null,
  "cost_source_quote": "verbatim, or null",
  "cost_notes": ["anything about WHEN payment is due, which decides whether funding help is even possible"],
  "format": "online / in person / hybrid, as published",
  "format_source_quote": "verbatim, or null",
  "cohorts": [{"cohort_id":"","days":"","time":"","start_date":"YYYY-MM-DD","end_date":"YYYY-MM-DD or null","status":"upcoming|already_started|unknown","status_note":""}],

    "translations": [{"page_says":"verbatim institutional sentence","you_say":"the same thing a person would actually understand"}]
  }
}

Hard rules:
- Every *_source_quote and every page_says MUST be text copied EXACTLY from the page below,
  character for character. It will be checked against the page automatically and the run
  fails if it is not there. Never paraphrase into a quote. If there is no sentence to quote,
  use null and raise a data_quality_flag instead.
- Never infer a cost, a date, or a requirement that is not stated. Missing means a flag with
  severity "incomplete".
- If the page contradicts itself, or looks abandoned (placeholder contact details, dates that
  end before they start), raise a flag with severity "do_not_rely" or "confirm_before_relying"
  and say exactly what conflicts.
- "you_say" lines must read at roughly a 6th grade level. Short words, short sentences, no
  institutional nouns.
